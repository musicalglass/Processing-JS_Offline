To view Processing-JS Programs offline:
If you haven't already downloaded the archive through a direct link already, click on the Download ZIP tab at the right of the Processing-JS_Offline web page. 
The archive will automatically pack itself into a ZIP file which will download into your default downloads folder. 
After UnZipping the file into the folder of your choice, open the index.html page with your Web Browser and you can view a number of sample Programs embedded in Web Pages.

Creating your own files for offline viewing is relatively easy if you understand a little basic HTML.
Copy your Program code and open the file:
template.js 
using Notepad or your favorite text editor.

Paste your program into the designated area. Save As a text only file and name the file 
programName.js 

Now open the Template.html page, scroll down to the bottom, and replace the name that refers to template.js with programName.js . 
You may also change the title of the page etc. if you like. Save As and rename your Template to 
programName.html. 

That should be it :) if you open programName.html in your web browser, you should be able to view your Program offline.
